# Password-Generator-Challenge
I have been asked to create a password generator which combines the use of; CSS, HTML &amp; JAVASCRIPT. 
The instructions and requirements for this challenge:
## Instructions
* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
    * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
    * Lowercase
    * Uppercase
    * Numeric
    * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
